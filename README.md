# TicTacToe

  For this project, I created a playable version of Tic-Tac-Toe on the command line using Java. When the program begins, the user will have the choice of selecting a human or computer opponent. If the user selects a computer opponent, the computer will block the user's moves each time, preventing them from winning. If the user selects a human opponent, the game will allow two users to alternate between placing X's or O's on the board until someone wins or there is a draw. 

## What I Learned

  This project has been really beneficial because it is the first time I have experiemented with implementing a simple AI in a program. Since the logic behind Tic-Tac-Toe only allows for a limited number of possibilities, it proved to be a good exercise in developing methods that would counter each of the user's moves. Additionally, within this program I strived to create small methods broken up into various classes to create clean, readable code. I found myself going back a number of times to refactor my code to keep any one class or method from becoming too bulky.
